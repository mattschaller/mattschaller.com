            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              I have over 10 years of experience as a software engineer, and team
              builder. I have overseen product development, ran large
              distributed engineering teams, and have significant experience
              surrounding ecommerce and software-as-a-service. I have worked on
              dozens of ecommerce
              implementations for large retail brands, and successfully scaled an enterprise B2B
              ecommerce solution to over 100 million dollars per year in
              transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am always looking to grow as an engineer and a leader, hear
              about interesting projects and opportunities, and meeting like-minded people. Feel free to
